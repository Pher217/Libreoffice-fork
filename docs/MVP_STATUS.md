# OfficeLabs Development Status

**Updated:** October 2025  
**Current Phase:** Architecture & Design → Fork Implementation

---

## 🎯 Project Evolution

### From Extension to Native Fork

OfficeLabs has **evolved** from an extension-based approach to a **full LibreOffice fork** with deeply integrated AI capabilities.

**Why the change?**
- Extensions have limited UI control
- Native integration provides better UX
- Full control over the office suite experience
- Inspired by Cursor's deep VS Code integration

---

## 📊 Current Status: Phase 0 Complete ✅

### ✅ What's Complete (October 2025)

**Architecture & Design (Phase 0)**
- [x] **Fork Architecture Defined** - Complete technical specification
- [x] **Agent System Designed** - Modular agent architecture for Writer/Calc/Impress/Macro
- [x] **UI Integration Plan** - Native VCL widget integration strategy
- [x] **Build System Strategy** - LibreOffice build system integration
- [x] **IPC Protocol** - JSON-RPC over Unix sockets/named pipes
- [x] **Documentation Framework** - Comprehensive docs created

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `docs/FORK_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture

## 🔄 What's Changing

### Old Approach (Extension-based)
```
LibreOffice (unchanged)
    ↓
OfficeLabs Extension (.oxt)
    ↓
PyUNO Bridge
    ↓
Sidebar Panel
```

**Limitations:**
- Limited UI control
- Sidebar only
- Feels "bolted on"
- Can't modify core UX

### New Approach (Native Fork)
```
OfficeLabs Core (LibreOffice fork)
    ↓
Native AI Chat Widget (VCL)
    ↓
Agent Integration Layer (C++)
    ↓
IPC Bridge (Unix socket)
    ↓
Agent Service (Python/FastAPI)
```

**Advantages:**
- Full UI control
- Native widgets (chat panel, command palette, ghost text)
- Seamless UX like Cursor
- OfficeLabs branding throughout

## 🧪 What You Can Test Now

### Current Prototype (Extension-based)

The extension-based prototype exists in this repository but has limitations:

**What Works:**
- ✅ Agent service backend
- ✅ Document indexing logic
- ✅ @-addressing concept
- ✅ REST API

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ LibreOffice sidebar integration (UNO complexity)
- ❌ Visual UI in LibreOffice

**To Test:**
```bash
# Start agent service
cd officelabs-agent
python -m src.main

# Test health
curl http://localhost:8765/health

# Test indexing
python test_agent_simple.py
```

## 💡 Why This Matters

### The Problem with Extensions

LibreOffice extensions are **limited**:
- Can only add sidebars or dialogs
- Limited UI customization
- Feel like plugins, not native features
- Complex UNO API

### The Fork Advantage

With a fork, we can:
- ✨ **Native AI Chat Panel** - Built into the core UI
- 👻 **Inline Ghost Text** - Cursor-style suggestions
- ⌨️ **Command Palette** - `Ctrl+K` for quick AI actions
- 🎨 **Custom Theme** - OfficeLabs branding throughout
- 🚀 **Performance** - Direct C++ integration, no PyUNO overhead

**Just like Cursor did for VS Code!**
